# HF-simulation
The codes of MonteCarlo method which aims to give the simulation of MuSEUM experiment; particle/nuclear physics experiment to measure the Hyperfine Splitting of Muonium at J-PARC. I use ROOT and GEANT4.

1. RF.cc and RF.hh
To calculate the TMmode of microware in the cavity. We use TM110 and TM210 mode to demo the RF respectively.

2. magnet.cc and magnet.hh
To calculate the magnetic field about 1.7 T of superconductive magnet. This magnet will use at MuSEUM experiment and muon(g-2) experiment in future.
